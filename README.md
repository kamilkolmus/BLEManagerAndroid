# BLE Manager for Android 
Universal application for Bluetooth low energy that allows you to display data on the graph in real time from many charateristics

Currently work:
-scaning BLE devices
-discover service and charateristrics
-implemented action for premisions: write, read, notify and indicate
-ability to add and display transmitted charateristics on the graph if the values are sent as: float, integer or as string (values parsed to float)

For testing, I use my own design device for measure PPG signal (two channels) with Bletooth low energy module
